<!-- No need for script tag in here (the src index.html) when using HTMLWebpackPlugin-->

<!-- 
  My issue with HTML webpack plugin was that the template was pointing to index.ejs by default, 
  had to set it to ./src/index.html. make sure you always do this template 
  The plugin rewrites this file from src and generates a new index.html in dist just in case we rename any entry points
  The index.html file in dist is literally just a copy of the one in src. 
 -->

<!-- 
  Without the plugin, it works fine too.
  You just need one index.html file, always make it in src, 
  comment out htmlwebpackplugin in webpack.config.js, and put -> script src = "main.js" defer <- in here
  It works the same but doesn't make a new index.html file in dist
